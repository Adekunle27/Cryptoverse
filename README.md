Good morning Mandeep üòä

I really like the work you've done on Cryptoverse so far. 

Here's a list of todos to improve the project even further, you can solve them in order:
[]  Refactor Redux to use Redux Toolkit Query -> you've already learned how that works üëç
[]  Use Ant Design properly - With Ant Design or any other UI kit, there should be minimal need for any custom CSS.
    Refactor the app to use Ant Design components - https://ant.design/components/overview.
    For example, you should never use p tags or h1 tags, Ant Design has Title or Paragraph components for that.
    Similarly, there are components for the layout, such as Divider, Grid, Layout and Space.
    Also Pagination, Input, Avatar, Badges, Lists, Tables and basically anything you can think of.
    To sum up, remove all the css and build the entire layout using Ant Design's components.
[]  Remove the react-icons package and instead use @ant-design/icons - https://ant.design/components/icon
[]  The news image is skewed, try to fix the aspect ratio
[]  Deploy the app and do thorough testing both on desktop and on mobile
[]  Add some new features that you had in mind
